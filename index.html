<b> Although I used a design template, I coded most of the website myself :))</b>


<p>Hi! I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park where I studied Information Science (InfoSci). InfoSci is a field 
  at the intersecton of humanities and technology. With a focus on the socio-technical aspect of technology rather than just the 
  technical aspect, I am was able to explore technology in various contexts. 

  I recently just finished up an internship at the Library of Congress, in the Congressional Research Service working on
  a text mining model that was foundational for moving forward with their AI initiative. 
</p>
<!--<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>
<p>My current research interest is in regards to data collection with social sciences and technology usage in government services. One of the biggest
    reasons I switched from a more technical background was the lack of inclusion of the humanities aspect regarding technology. Usability is just as important
    as functionality! I am currently doing research as a Visting Fellow at The University of Texas Austin with the ISchool Inclusion Institute. 
</p>--> 
<h2 id="Works">Current Works</h2>

<p> Apart from research I am really looking into exploring various technological pratices:
    <ul>
        <li>Data Science</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
        <li>Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Creative Coding</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    Currently working on building projects for my portfolio and trying to build as much in relation to LLMs, data visuzalization and more! 
   <h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>
    <p>I have done research in a couple of different avenues, academic and industrial.

    One of my goals this year is to get my Javascript knowledge back up to a higher proficiency. Check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/sehbaw"></a>Github.</a>

<h2 id="Works">Hobbies</h2>   
    <p>
        In my free time, I really like to spend time doing no-screen activities or teaching! I really have become fond of holding free workshops regarding creative technology
        as it helps to bridge the gap of computer science knowledge
